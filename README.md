**App Evaluation**
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

**Category:** Entertainment

**Mobile:** This app experience brings a database of Pokémon to the palm of your hands. This app will come in handy when you need to know a specific fact or detail from a trusted source.

**Story:** This app will be a fun experience for Pokémon fans.It will show recognizable names and images which should elicit a positive response from fans.

**Market:** This app targets a niche group of people, specifically gamers who are fans of Pokémon.This app could potentially attract non-gamers that have familiarity of the Pokémon series through other mediums like TV/Movies, toys etc.

**Habit:** This app could become essential to an avid gamer since Pokémon games often rely on character stats to win battles. This app would be the users main tool for looking up any potential information.

**Scope:** The goal for this app is to display a list containing the Pokémon with some sort of categorization implemented. When selecting a Pokémon, the app would take you to the page displaying the main information for the Pokémon.This early version should still prove useful considering it will still display relevent information.

**Product Spec**
1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

    **Required Must-have Stories**
    - Should properly display a list of content.
    - Each item in the list should be clickable and open to another page.
    - User should be able to see available data for each item.
   **Optional Nice-to-have Stories**
    - Add categorization for the list.

2. Screen Archetypes

    - App will open to the stream page where the user will be presented with a list view with the Pokémon.

    - I might consider,
        App can open to a home screen style screen which would show the different categories of Pokémon along with a random selection for the user to look at.

    - Additionally there would be a Detail screen which shocases the details/facts of the selected Pokémon.

3. Navigation
*Tab Navigation (Tab to Screen)*

    - First tab could be the "Home" screen mentioned above.
    - Second tab would include the list view of all of the         Pokémon.
    - Third tab: Settings? Credits?
